# Components

## Props

## State


### When should I use each?

|   Class Component                 |   Stateless Component      |
|:----------------------:           |:-----------------:         |
| State                             |  Everywhere else           |
| Refs                              |                            |
| Lifecycle methods                 |                            |
| Child functions (for performance) |                            |

### When to use?

|   Container Component(Smart, Stateful, Controller View)   |   Presentation Component(Dumb, Stateless, View)      |
|:---------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------:|
| Little to no markup                                       |  Nearly all markup                                   |
| Focus on how things work                                  |  Focus on how things looks                           |
| Pass data and actions down/subscribe to Redux State       |Receive data and actions via props                    |
| Knows about Redux                                         |Doesn’t know about Redux                              |
| Often stateful                                            |Typically functional components                       |
| Dispatch Redux actions                                    |Invoke callbacks on props                             |
| Generated by react-redux                                  |Written by hand                                       |

### State management

|   Flux                                                    |                       Redux                          |
|:---------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------:|
| Stores contain state and change logic                     |  Store and change logic are separate                 |
| Multiple stores                                           |One store                                             |
| Flat and disconnected stores                              |Single store with hierarchical reducers               |
| Singleton dispatcher                                      |No dispatcher                                         |
| React components subscribe to stores                      |Container components utilize connect                  |
| State is mutated                                          |State is immutable                                    |

### 3 Principles of Redux
- Immutable Store
- Actions trigger changes
- Reducers return updated state

### Handling Immutable State

|   ES6          |     ES5       |   Libraries        |
|:--------------:|:-------------:|:------------------:|
| Object.assign  |  Lodash merge |react-addons-update |
| Spead operator | Lodash extend |Immutable.js        |
|                |Object-assign  |                    |
